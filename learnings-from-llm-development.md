# Learnings from LLM-Driven Development

I am in the final stages of a product design and context engineering project driven by NLP and LLM code generation.

## What have I learned so far?

The idea of agentic-first development is appealing, but reality requires a more fact-grounded approach. LLMs have no contextual memory—all the hacks produce results, but the risk of context poisoning and hallucination is here to stay.

On the other hand, using tools and agents with limited scope and clear context can accelerate the development process immensely.

This alone is revolutionary enough—a fundamental change in the traditional hand-off and prototyping workflow that will be applied in the future.

I spent more time directly prototyping with HTML, JS, and CSS than clicking in Figma. Using an LLM as a pair developer for cumbersome tasks is a delight (when you invest the time to ground the prompt in documentation and clarity).

You can build a functional MVP with PRD, planning, and context engineering done exclusively through your general knowledge of software development, best practices, etc.

This gives teams the option to explore possibilities, test, and prioritize functionality with lightning speed—and should motivate focus on qualitative improvements rather than speed of deployment.

Another added bonus is the ability of LLMs to generate comprehensive documentation, analyze code, and provide directions based on statistical data.

So avoid the hype (AI winter is coming) and play with the core tools, not the wrappers, to understand and feel the limitations of the technology.
