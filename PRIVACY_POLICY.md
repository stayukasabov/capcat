**Effective Date:** October 13, 2025

## Overview

This Privacy Policy describes how Capcat ("we", "us", or "our") handles information when you use our news archiving software. Capcat is a personal news archiving tool that enables users to make copies of publicly available news articles for personal use.

## Information We Collect and Process

### Information You Provide
When using Capcat, you provide:
- Article URLs for archiving
- Configuration settings and preferences

### Information Automatically Collected
Capcat automatically processes:
- Public content from news websites (articles, images, comments)
- Metadata from these articles (title, author, publication date)

### Information We Do NOT Collect
- Personal identification information
- Login credentials
- Financial information
- Health information
- Any other personal data

## How We Use Information

Capcat processes publicly available content solely for the purpose of creating personal offline archives of news articles for educational, research, and accessibility purposes.

## Data Processing Principles

### Public Content Only
Capcat processes only content that is publicly available on the internet without requiring authentication or payment.

### No Personal Data Collection
Capcat does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information about users or commenters beyond what is publicly available on news sites.

### Privacy by Design for Comments
When processing comments, Capcat implements privacy protections by:
- Anonymizing usernames as "Anonymous" 
- Preserving original profile links for reference to source websites
- Not storing any personal identification information

## Data Storage and Retention

### Local Storage Only
All data processed by Capcat is stored locally on your device in organized folder structures:
- Single articles: `../Capcats/` directory
- Batch processing: `../News/` directory

### No Cloud Storage
Capcat does not upload any data to external servers or cloud services.

### User Control
You have complete control over the data stored by Capcat and can delete any archived content at any time.

## Data Sharing

### No Data Sharing
Capcat does not share, sell, or transmit any user data to third parties.

### Content Attribution
When creating archives, Capcat preserves attribution to original sources with functioning links to maintain proper content ownership.

## Your Rights and Choices

As a user of Capcat, you have the following rights:

### Access and Control
- You can access all data stored by Capcat on your device
- You can delete any archived content at any time
- You control your configuration settings and preferences

### No Data Portability Requests Needed
Since no personal data is collected by Capcat, data portability requests are not applicable.

### No Consent Withdrawal Needed
Since no personal data is collected and no consent is required for processing public content, there is no need to withdraw consent.

## Third-Party Services

Capcat accesses content from third-party news websites solely through:
- RSS feeds (when available)
- Public HTML pages
- Official APIs (when available and preferred)

Capcat does not control the privacy practices of these third-party websites. Please review their individual privacy policies.

## Data Security

### Secure Network Practices
Capcat implements standard security practices for network operations:
- Configurable timeouts for network operations
- Session pooling with connection limits
- Standard User-Agent identification
- Configurable retry mechanisms with delays

### Local Data Protection
Since all data is stored locally on your device:
- You control access to your data
- You can implement your own security measures (encryption, access controls, etc.)
- Capcat does not interfere with your local security settings

## Data Retention and Deletion

### User-Controlled Retention
- You control how long data is retained on your device
- Capcat creates local archives but does not enforce retention periods
- You may delete any archived content at any time

### Automatic Cleanup
- Temporary files (like raw HTML) are automatically deleted after processing
- No persistent logs of personal information are maintained

## Children's Privacy

Capcat does not collect or process personal information from children under 13 years of age. The software processes only publicly available news content, which may or may not be appropriate for children depending on the source.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. We will notify users of any material changes by:
- Updating the effective date at the top of this policy
- Maintaining the same core privacy principles regardless of updates
