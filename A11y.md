1. Missing Alt Text on Images
Several decorative images lack proper alt text:

Icon images (Command-Line Mode, Interactive Menu, Bulk RSS Fetching, etc.) have alt text that's just the heading text, not describing the icon's visual appearance
The "Crowd background illustration" and mascot image have alt text that doesn't follow best practices (contains "Illustration by" credit in alt text)

2. Problematic Heading Structure

The main heading reads "Defined with natural language processing. Built with large language models.A Minimum viabl" - this appears truncated and concatenated incorrectly
Text "A Minimum viable product" should be properly separated

3. Code Blocks Lack Proper Labeling
The code snippets throughout the page don't have proper programmatic labels. Screen reader users won't know these are code blocks unless they use semantic HTML elements or ARIA labels.
4. Color Contrast Issues

Orange heading text on beige background may not meet WCAG contrast requirements
Some gray text in footer might have insufficient contrast

Moderate Issues
5. Navigation Menu

The "Toggle menu" button lacks indication of its expanded/collapsed state (missing aria-expanded attribute)
No visible skip-to-main-content link for keyboard users

6. Links Opening in New Windows
While the links do indicate "(opens in new window)" in their accessible names, this relies on text-only notification which is good, but could be enhanced.
7. List Semantics
The numbered steps (1-5) in "How Capcat Works" section appear to use visual numbers rather than an ordered list structure, which would be better for screen readers.
8. Interactive Elements

The "Copy code to clipboard" buttons need clearer feedback for successful copies
No visible focus indicators shown in screenshots (would need keyboard testing to confirm)

Minor Issues
9. Landmark Regions

Good use of semantic regions (banner, navigation, contentinfo)
However, multiple generic regions without descriptive labels could be improved with aria-label attributes

10. Link Context
Some links like "View Capcat features" and "Learn how Capcat works" are clear, but several tutorial links repeat the same text ("Managing Your Sources" appears twice), which could confuse screen reader users navigating by links list.
Positive Aspects ✓

Good semantic HTML structure with proper landmarks
Links have descriptive accessible names
Proper heading hierarchy in most sections
External links properly indicated
Good use of lists for navigation and content organization

Recommendations

Add descriptive alt text to all images or mark decorative ones as alt=""
Fix the truncated heading text
Use <code> and <pre> elements for code blocks
Test and improve color contrast ratios
Add aria-expanded to the mobile menu button
Use actual <ol> for numbered lists
Add unique, descriptive labels for repeated links
Ensure all interactive elements have visible focus indicators
Add a skip-to-main-content link
