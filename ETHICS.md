# Capcat - Project Ethics & Responsible Use Policy

## Our Philosophy

Capcat is a powerful tool designed to help users create personal, offline archives of web articles for educational, research, and accessibility purposes. The internet is ephemeral, and our goal is to empower individuals to preserve information that is important to them.

With this power comes a responsibility to act ethically. We are committed to a set of principles that respect both the creators of the content and the web infrastructure that delivers it. This document outlines our commitment and provides clear guidance for all users and contributors.

## Core Principles

1.  **Respect for Copyright and Creators**: Capcat is intended for creating a *personal copy* of publicly accessible content for individual use. It should not be used to create public-facing mirrors, to redistribute copyrighted material, or for any commercial purpose. We operate on the principle of fair use/fair dealing for personal archiving.

2.  **No Paywall Circumvention**: This is a foundational rule. Capcat is intentionally designed **not** to access, bypass, or otherwise circumvent paywalls or subscription-based systems. We believe that if a publisher requires payment for content, that choice must be respected. Contributions to the project that attempt to add this functionality will be rejected.

3.  **Being a Good Web Citizen**: Automated tools can place a heavy load on web servers. Capcat is built with configurable limits and conservative default settings to minimize impact. We are committed to being a "good citizen" of the web and not disrupting the services we rely on.

4.  **Adherence to Web Standards**: We respect machine-readable standards like `robots.txt`. The project is designed to check and honor these directives, which signal the intent of website administrators regarding automated access.

5.  **Transparency**: Capcat is a Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS) project. Our code is open for public scrutiny to verify that we adhere to these principles.

## Guidance for Users

By using Capcat, you agree to do so responsibly. We strongly encourage you to:

*   **Keep Default Settings**: The default rate limits and concurrent worker settings are designed to be respectful to web servers. Please do not lower delays or raise worker counts excessively.
*   **Understand the Terms of Service**: Be aware of the Terms of Service (ToS) for any website you access with this tool.
*   **Personal Use Only**: Do not use Capcat to download articles for public redistribution or for any commercial purpose.
*   **Acknowledge Your Responsibility**: You are solely responsible for how you use this software. You must ensure that your use complies with the laws of your jurisdiction and the terms of the websites you access.

## Guidance for Contributors

We welcome contributions that align with our ethical principles. When contributing code, especially for new sources, please adhere to the following:

*   **No Paywalled Sources**: Do not add sources that are behind a hard paywall or require a subscription.
*   **Respect Anti-Bot Measures**: If a site employs aggressive anti-scraping measures, view it as a clear signal that they do not wish to be scraped. Do not add functionality to circumvent these measures.
*   **Prioritize Official APIs**: If a source offers a public API, it should be preferred over HTML scraping.
